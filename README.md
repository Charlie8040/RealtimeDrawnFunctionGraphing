# RealtimeDrawnFunctionGraphing
Uses OpenCV, Python, MatPlotLib, and a user's webcam to map any function drawn on a piece of paper to a f(x) function and determines the area in square-inches underneath the function. The output function is graphed and overlayed in real time over the users drawn function.
